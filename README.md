# LeetCode in Rust

This repository contains my attempts to solve the LeetCode challenge using Rust. The goal is to tackle each problem in an idiomatic Rust way, leveraging the languageâ€™s strengths and best practices.

In addition to solving the problems, this repository serves as a journal of my Rustaceans journey, where I document my growth and learning in Rust programming.
